a knife or gun is considered a deadly weapon and use of force by the police in those situations are legal. A taser is a non-lethal device by law. The act of shooting a fleeing Brooks in the back while he presented no deadly weapons and only a stolen non-lethal device is... illegal

It‚Äôs tragic how this all unfolded. Unfortunately, once the officers suspected a DIU they had to follow the rules. Changing laws for minor crimes like DIU where the car is impounded and the suspect is ticketed and told to report to court instead of being handcuffed and arrested would have avoided this confrontation.

I watched the entire video multiple times and was shocked how professional that the cops were. They bent over backwards being professional to a guy obviously impaired and the number that he blew proved that. In other words, the guy was bombed and then instead of him complying he acted aggressively grabbing the taser gun and now the cops feared if they were hit and down he could have grabbed the gun and killed them.

I always ask myself the same question when it comes to police shootings. ""Don't they train to know where to aim?""

There's a massive difference in aiming at someone with a deadly weapon assaulting you and chasing someone. The guy used a taser, the officer probably panicked, it's understandable that maybe he lost composure in that moment. But this is a prime example of a) where police training fails & b) why police shouldn't be armed.

A taser, if used for too long, can in fact be deadly or at least cause sever brain damage, to the point of putting someone in a vegetative state. Once tased, the officer would then have zero control over the situation. What a sad situation from all perspectives.

The officer should of taken control of him from the first second. He's walking up and down telling the man to keep looking for his license. It's so frustrating. They're either putting their foot on your neck or they're walking around like you are their best friend. Just do your damn job. That's what the public wants. We want you to follow procedure and then you go home and they either go home or to jail. But at least all concerned still have their life.

Yes he made a mistake, but there was no reason for the police to shoot him. You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest. In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill. Shooting and killing this fleeing criminal made the police the judge and the jury on that man‚Äôs life. If they had let him go then, the law would still have caught up with him eventually. Not all criminals deserve the death penalty.

First of all he was o  private property, a drive through if I am not mistaken, which means that the cops have no authority to be there even if he is sleeping, and over the influence of alcohol.
The fact that they shoot him because he did not want to go to jail for a crime that is punished by a ticket, is no reason to shoot him leathaly, they should try and catch him or seize the car, after all he would eventually come back for it.

Some people are sick in the head. Dui, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer are all crimes and he should have received 2 to 8 years in prison depending on the judge. Not a death sentence on the spot. No man should be judge jury and executioner as that cop chose to be.

The Chief mentions the protocol for when deadly forced is authorized via policy, that stems from Tennessee v. Garner if you want to read up on it. All he had was 1 shot of the officers own taser, should not have escalated to the point it did. It was a bad shooting (per policy) which is why it was a clear cut case for the police to have him turn in his badge and face charges.

I don't know if anyone is catching it but the cop who was chasing him had already stuck his taser cables into Brooks. It looked like he was running with those attached and at some point he pointed the taser that he grabbed as a way to ward off by maybe trying to distract the cop so he could put distance between them. I also am wondering from some of the other footage, it looks like the cop pulled out his taser and hit him with it and Brooks grabbed it to keep it from being used against him. Then decided that it might be best to take it with him as he ran away so that it couldn't be used to electrocute him as he fled.

In this day and age it is NOT beneficial to your health to run from the cops AND fire a taser at them.  The cops should've just caught up with him later on when he came home to make the arrest. His life saved and money in their pockets.

It‚Äôs just another day at the office for these guys, smh so sad. Shoot an impaired man in the back because he pointed a taser off to the side low to the ground. The man would have clearly missed & you fire 3 rounds at damn near point blank range. He is a human being!!! Did everyone else see the cops face while he was questioning him...??

He must have concluded that there would be more of a problem for him if he were taken in right then. Because running only adds additional charges and an arrest later, with additional punishment. That's alcohol.

They had a reason to shoot him during the fight but they had no reason to chase him and shoot him down since they had his ID. It's not self defense if you chase and kill a person who's in possession of a non lethal weapon while you have a gun.

In Canada hear they usually first will block his car so he/she can‚Äôt drive off, then they will ask questions while you are in the car. At no time do they allow you to get out of the car until more officers arrive. At that point they might put handcuffs on you for the safety of both parties.

So a baseball bat is considered less than lethal but when you swing it a few times it can become lethal. A taser can be lethal if the person getting hit falls to the ground and hit their head on the ground and dies. He didn't want to go to jail that night for owi so he paid with his life.

Gotta love that alcohol.  I'm thinking, as I watched it, ""what in gawd's name do you think you  are doing?!!!!!!""  He should not have been shot, they had his license, knew where he lived, they should have let him go. 

I saw a headline that cops are resigning in rather large numbers and I can't blame them.  Every time a cop is attacked and takes someone down (NOT fatally) he's going to have hell to pay.  Sometimes they have to take someone down.  Someone on meth or other drugs can be crazy, super strong because with the drugs in them they don't feel pain and just keep coming.  We are in a mess right now and that orange nightmare is loving every minute.

The officer was too focused on getting the arrest. The man was drunk and calm. So I think the officer didn't have to rush to arrest him. He tried to handcuff him in a few seconds. I feel this could've had a very safe outcome if the officer would've kept a calm pace and explain the the guy first, then arrest, just as he took time to explain and confirm about the breath test.  The man may have turned around by himself and surrendered.

Some shootings are just hate and unprovoked.  But most of these cop shootings involved some kind of struggle and running away.  Brooks struggled and fight his way including grabbing the police taser.   Even if Brooks is patted down and has no weapon on him.  Once he stole the taser, he can use it on the officer and then grab his gun.    Travon Martin also fought and tried to grab the gun away.   In the video, George Floyd also resisted and struggled with the police several moments before being kneed to death..  But these has a cause and effect, despite its overuse of force.  It may be the police force policy or training that made cops do this when the suspect is not complying.

"You conveniently left out that in the struggle he also ripped away a taser from one of the officers, and was actively trying to use it."
a knife or gun is considered a deadly weapon and use of force by the police in those situations are legal. A taser is a non-lethal device by law. The act of shooting a fleeing Brooks in the back while he presented no deadly weapons and only a stolen non-lethal device is... illegal
"It‚Äôs tragic how this all unfolded. Unfortunately, once the officers suspected a DIU they had to follow the rules. Changing laws for minor crimes like DIU where the car is impounded and the suspect is ticketed and told to report to court instead of being handcuffed and arrested would have avoided this confrontation.

The fact this is what you choose to cover shows your true intentions.
"I watched the entire video multiple times and was shocked how professional that the cops were. They bent over backwards being professional to a guy obviously impaired and the number that he blew proved that.

"I always ask myself the same question when it comes to police shootings. ""Don't they train to know where to aim?""

There's a massive difference in aiming at someone with a deadly weapon assaulting you and chasing someone. The guy used a taser, the officer probably panicked, it's understandable that maybe he lost composure in that moment. But this is a prime example of a) where police training fails & b) why police shouldn't be armed."

If you aim a weapon at an officer, you take a chance.  When you do all 4, you‚Äôre flipping a coin as to whether you‚Äôll come out alive."
I pray for his family but just comply people it‚Äôs easier than losing your life over something simple.
They woke him up told him to pull over to a parking spot and get some sleep but then he passed out again then the cops woke him up again and started questioning him. That was cut from the video.
"If he was in Wendy‚Äôs drive thru, what was the point of checking his person? They could of simply told him that he‚Äôs  drunk and that he either needs to call for a ride home or stay the night in his car at the Wendy‚Äôs until he sobers up. Why were they trying to arrest him if he wasn‚Äôt even on the road driving?"
It's sad to hear that this man was shot and killed by a police officer but at the same time do not put yourself in a situation to were u going to make it harder on yourself. Just corporate in the best way that u can and don't give any police officers a reason to take out their guns.
They sure cut that clip off quick!
"So the suspect is driving while under the influence of more than two times the legal limit, resists arrest, steals and points the officers taser at the him and people think this is okay?"
"This dude should have just complied and should have let the cops arrest him. If he thought he was innocent he could have fought it in court. They only hold you for 8 hrs in the drunk tank, he could have just done his 8 hrs gone home and get a lawyer; instead he wound up dead which is sad. I pray that everyone decides to change and make the right choices for the sake of their own health and the health of others!!!"
"Why resist arrest? If you are innocent, sort it out at the jail! People think, oh I'm going to get physical, and they will let me go?! Stupid!!"
"I'm so sorry for this man. Being drunk and resisting arrest is not a reason to get shot. That being said: you have the guy's car and patted him down. 

Police: LET HIM RUN. He was gonna get caught. Follow him around on your car to prevent him from getting hurt or something. It's amateur hour with the police."
"If they didnt want to deal with it that day, they could have said, "" call somebody to get you"" a lot of people get junk and fight all the time. They have no judgement. He had no weapon but taser."
Imagine if the cop just said we will have to give you a ride home you can‚Äôt operate your vehicle for the night. But not in this day and age where all of this at the end was about money not justice but money. America is not a country it‚Äôs a business.
I wish they would do a story on what happened to Breonna Taylor.  She was an EMT shot in her own home by police during a no-knock raid.
"A taser, if used for too long, can in fact be deadly or at least cause sever brain damage, to the point of putting someone in a vegetative state. Once tased, the officer would then have zero control over the situation. What a sad situation from all perspectives."
The officer should of taken control of him from the first second. He's walking up and down telling the man to keep looking for his license. It's so frustrating. They're either putting their foot on your neck or they're walking around like you are their best friend. Just do your damn job. That's what the public wants. We want you to follow procedure and then you go home and they either go home or to jail. But at least all concerned still have their life.
Holy shit! What a tragedy!
"Hi there, I‚Äôm Rashard Brooks. I was sentenced to 7 years in prison for beating my KIDS. I was paroled due to the covid-19.
I drove drunk to Wendy‚Äôs and passed out in the drive through line, when a cop tried to arrest me for my 2nd dui I stole his taser and fired it at him because I knew I would be sent back to prison...I‚Äôm a martyr now..."
How can someone running away from you pose an imminent threat?
"He couldn‚Äôt have been that drunk if he was asleep at the drive through of Wendy‚Äôs. Now if you found someone in the drive through Taco Bell asleep after ordering a Crunchwrap,that person is beyond drunk falling asleep after having placed such a dank order."
"The suspect held all the power in regards to what happened during the investigation.   At any time he could have submitted.  Too many suspects believe they can stop an arrest, they cannot.  Submit to the arrest and fight the charges later..if you don't think you should be arrested DO NOT FIGHT, TALK TO OR RUN FROM THE OFFICER IT IS NOT THE TIME!!!!!"
"The police in this case was clearly seeking for an excuse to kill this man.  How in the world could we call those individuals law enforcement?

These practices are obviously deathly wrong, and are nothing, but lynching."
"Very sad ending!   First of all, the suspect is mainly responsible for his own death.  Get out of the car and comply with the police.  You don't fight with the police, take any weapon and run. Yes, a taser can't kill you , but you mustn't take anything from the police.  What was the purpose of said action?!"
"the suspect resisted, fought with the cops, supposedly took a taser from one of the cops, tried to escape, then turned around and fired the taser at the cop. This is not a Floyd case. The cop had no choice. It's all clear in the video."
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right but resisting arrest is never a good idea
There's a 43 minute unedited version of the police cam that shows 41 minutes of an ordinary decent police officer doing his duty politely and courteously and 2 minutes of a criminal resisting arrest!
"You do not have to do the field sobriety test,as you can fail it for normal reasons,they can not make you do it"
Smh.  Why did he resist!? Ô∏è. Clearly this could have been prevented
The thing is didn't have to kill him I think he was just complying initially but he should have never fought back. He put the cops in a difficult position. But the cops could have also taken his keys and drove him. Then issue a summons so you can appear in court.
They edited out alot of footage..the police were not mean to him he chose to resist arrest after approximately 40 mins of talking calmly to him
There is something really wrong with the police in the States. Things like this are happening once in a decade here in Europe.
"""I'm really concerned that military has been brought in and the National Guard ‚Äî I think that's a really radical step,"" Lia Cheek, 32, told Business Insider. ""Part of me feels like it's turning into a military state.""
""It's a sign of who our president is ‚Äî he likes to control, he likes to bully, and he's using our military and our people and our tax dollars to bully us and control us, and that's not OK,"" she added. ""We need to keep protesting and using our voices."""
he got what he deserved  !!  the video shows that the police officer was doing his job  !!  thanks for your job well done police officer  !!   GOD BLESS you all out there  !!
He took one of the officers tasers and ran. Just not caught on this clip that they showed.
"The sad thing is,is he could have refused the breathalyzer.They were not sure what he was doing.They didnt suspect he was drunk at first.And they didnt catch him driver drunk either.Just parked resting.They didnt have to do anything but drive him home.Instead they chose to go this route smh."
This is beyond any comprehension. He was compliant and was not endangering anybody‚Äôs life. Why use such deadly force?
I'm sorry for what happen but that's way different from what happen to George Floyd. That guy shouldn't have done that
"Yes he made a mistake, but there was no reason for the police to shoot him. You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest. In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill. Shooting and killing this fleeing criminal made the police the judge and the jury on that man‚Äôs life. If they had let him go then, the law would still have caught up with him eventually. Not all criminals deserve the death penalty."
"Imminent threat includes him incapacitating an officer with the tazer and then possibly gaining posession of the service weapon. Split second like that, he had already showed himself to be willing to steal a weapon and use it."
"He might of been drunk and when they were gonna cuff him he drunkenly thought ""heres my chance to dip"", as any self respecting drunk person would at least think of."
"Just terrible that lethal force was used. If he just wasn't drunk, blocked a business, failed a FST, resisted arrest, fought with them to get away, TOOK THE LEOs TASER, FIRED IT AT HIM while fleeing....none of this would have ever happened."
"""APD SHOOTING EXPLAINED
Before reading below, remember that officers are afforded the same constitutional rights as citizens, so whether they‚Äôre charged for political reasons or not, the facts of the case remain the same until their day in court:"
We got to do better we got to think before we act
"Even if he had a gun, why do they shoot at him? Why can‚Äôt they run after him or just let him go? They have his car there to get his identification so that they can deal with him later.  How sick is the mind of police to think they can just shoot someone because a person did not subject to them?!?! Sick!"
"this one's contentious but I think we can all agree that he didn't have to lose his life given that he was initially co-operating and interacting with the officer in a friendly manner

if you have to shoot, why not shoot in the leg or another area where death by gunshot wound is unlikely?"
He seems to be standing on one leg just fine.
The punishment for assaulting an officer isn‚Äôt death. He was running away when they shot him. He was not a threat to the officers‚Äô health at that point!
"I don't know how many have seen this story on CNN. But the cars moved after rayshard was shot once. The same officer proceeded to walk  his way to Rayshard Brooks, still living body, and shot him in the back again."
Didnt that guy took the cop taser and shot it at him while running away?
"I dont know if this is actually on the cops.  You cant allow someone to struggle or flee when arresting them, even if you must shoot them, regardless of the offense.  Someone could have shoplifted a loaf of bread, but he tries to take your sidearm or run away there's no choice."
"So the guy fought the police when they tried to put handcuffs on him after being passed out drunk in a drivethru, got tazed and still ran off. Then the other camera angle from Wendy‚Äôs shows him take something from a cop and point it at them while trying to escape... Seems like a pretty bad guy to me, I‚Äôd expect to be shot if I did the same things he did"
Exactly! You have to be in fear of your life or protecting the life of someone else if you are to use deadly force!! You can‚Äôt just shoot a drunk guy because he panics and runs away. When the FUCK are these cops going to actually get it through their heads that this kind of policing is wrong?
"First of all he was o  private property, a drive through if I am not mistaken, which means that the cops have no authority to be there even if he is sleeping, and over the influence of alcohol.
The fact that they shoot him because he did not want to go to jail for a crime that is punished by a ticket, is no reason to shoot him leathaly, they should try and catch him or seize the car, after all he would eventually come back for it."
"Some people are sick in the head. Dui, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer are all crimes and he should have received 2 to 8 years in prison depending on the judge. Not a death sentence on the spot. No man should be judge jury and executioner as that cop chose to be."
"He could have just gotten away with a night in jail and maybe losing his driver's license, but he just had to resist arrest and run away with a taser (and then shoot it at the police ?? Huh ? ) , ok, that was stupid dude ! Guy nust have been really drunk or really high on drugs...."
"The Chief mentions the protocol for when deadly forced is authorized via policy, that stems from Tennessee v. Garner if you want to read up on it. All he had was 1 shot of the officers own taser, should not have escalated to the point it did. It was a bad shooting (per policy) which is why it was a clear cut case for the police to have him turn in his badge and face charges."
"If you watch the full video from the Wendy‚Äôs camera, the officers chased him down on foot and only shot at him after Brooks discharged the taser at them and headed for a car in the drive through."
"I don't know if anyone is catching it but the cop who was chasing him had already stuck his taser cables into Brooks. It looked like he was running with those attached and at some point he pointed the taser that he grabbed as a way to ward off by maybe trying to distract the cop so he could put distance between them. I also am wondering from some of the other footage, it looks like the cop pulled out his taser and hit him with it and Brooks grabbed it to keep it from being used against him. Then decided that it might be best to take it with him as he ran away so that it couldn't be used to electrocute him as he fled."
"We all are free to choose our sins,  not the consequences  of those sins."
I would like to see the police camera front of the vehicles.
"We need to apply across all states similar ""rules of engagement"" as it is written under the Geneva Convention. I am confident that only 90% off the entire police force does not follow, abide, by their states law. There needs to be a rule that governs all in which officers are hold accountable the same way as in the military. That way that are disciplined at the highest level in which they will comply and obey. It's all about discipline, and these officers do not have any."
In this day and age it is NOT beneficial to your health to run from the cops AND fire a taser at them.  The cops should've just caught up with him later on when he came home to make the arrest. His life saved and money in their pockets. 
"It‚Äôs just another day at the office for these guys, smh so sad. Shoot an impaired man in the back because he pointed a taser off to the side low to the ground. The man would have clearly missed & you fire 3 rounds at damn near point blank range. He is a human being!!! Did everyone else see the cops face while he was questioning him...?? He better get prosecuted."
"Although he did not need to be killed, I will always wonder why he ran."
"Regardless of him running away with the taser, he shouldn't have been shot to death. The police shouldn't be the judge, jury, and executioner over the decision to end an unarmed man's life."
"Well atleast the guy in this case had actually committed a crime and had resisted arrest, so it's a step up from simply being murdered outright as so often appears to be the case."
"He must have concluded that there would be more of a problem for him if he were taken in right then. Because running only adds additional charges and an arrest later, with additional punishment. That's alcohol."
They had a reason to shoot him during the fight but they had no reason to chase him and shoot him down since they had his ID. It's not self defense if you chase and kill a person who's in possession of a non lethal weapon while you have a gun.
How people are saying that the police shot him because he is black is absolutely mindblowing to me. They gave him 3 opportunities to pull into a parking space without a breathalyzer. Dude totally escalated the situation on his own.
What the hell?! Everything seemed by the book and calm until the cuffing. What spooked him?
"It's deadly to have a taser, specially one that does not belong to you."
I am seeing 3 things here. 1 police competence 2. Police incompetence 3. A felon who makes a bad decision to run. The cops checked that he didn‚Äôt have a weapon. How did he think he was gonna get away with not being arrested and then try and run and leave behind his car. He is gone now but demonstrates that each party must take some responsibility!
"In Canada hear they usually first will block his car so he/she can‚Äôt drive off, then they will ask questions while you are in the car. At no time do they allow you to get out of the car until more officers arrive. At that point they might put handcuffs on you for the safety of both parties. It was wrong of them asking him to get out of his car before asking him questions"
Have YOU seen the transcript.!?!?  It was NOT over 20 bucks  !!! He was outta his mind. The clerk was genuinely  concerned  for him
seems like if he was a potential threat they wouldn't have given him the opportunity to drive his car to the side from the beginning smh
The whole point here is STOP RESISTING ARREST!!!
"And this is the attitude of so many ....shoot someone if they‚Äôve done you wrong....if someone runs away  with your wallet/purse do you shoot them?
How you answer determines what side of humanity  you really are on .....
Awful ...and another example of why we need complete overhaul of the justice system"
Funny how they cut off 40 minutes of these officers going out of their way to be nice to this guy. It also showed just how drunk this guy was.
This makes sense. I was struggling with this one. But that last 20 seconds or so really drove the point home.
So a baseball bat is considered less than lethal but when you swing it a few times it can become lethal. A taser can be lethal if the person getting hit falls to the ground and hit their head on the ground and dies. He didn't want to go to jail that night for owi so he paid with his life.
"Gotta love that alcohol.  I'm thinking, as I watched it, ""what in gawd's name do you think you  are doing?!!!!!!""  He should not have been shot, they had his license, knew where he lived, they should have let him go. 

I saw a headline that cops are resigning in rather large numbers and I can't blame them.  Every time a cop is attacked and takes someone down (NOT fatally) he's going to have hell to pay.  Sometimes they have to take someone down.  Someone on meth or other drugs can be crazy, super strong because with the drugs in them they don't feel pain and just keep coming.  We are in a mess right now and that orange nightmare is loving every minute."
I agree he should not have done any of that with the police But that does not equal to a death sentence. You can still live on after being tased but you probably won‚Äôt make it after being shot by a gun
"The officer was too focused on getting the arrest. The man was drunk and calm. So I think the officer didn't have to rush to arrest him. He tried to handcuff him in a few seconds. I feel this could've had a very safe outcome if the officer would've kept a calm pace and explain the the guy first, then arrest, just as he took time to explain and confirm about the breath test.  The man may have turned around by himself and surrendered."
I was pinched for DWI over 30 years ago by 2 white cops. I was polite and listened to their commands. I ran a red light and was pulled over. They were justified in pulling me over. Went to the station and met the lieutenant. A gentleman who treated me with respect. He was doing his job. Did I curse him or threaten him or his officers? No. They noted this to the judge. I still had to pay a price. Yet I am alive today to speak about it.
No way this cop gets convicted.
"Yes, just carefully leave out the part where he took the taser from the police"
They had his car that could be traced to him and an arrest could have been made later. The chase and shooting was absolutely unnecessary
We should not over react. I believe they tried to do the right thing. Try to put yourself in their shoes.
There needs to be a new law that states you can only use your weapon (gun) if you know-see and record them having it and can confirm. Yes the man was dead wrong for running but police are supposed to be trained to take back control of these situations without taking the easy way out and killing someone. That should not even be a resort in this situation.
"Orig unedited footage showed a lot more. Multiple falling asleep cycles, him driving, hitting the curb & driving backwards, different versions of why he was there, amongst other things. After the scuffle, he ran, turned, & fired at the officer BEFORE the officer returned fire. Justified? Idk."
"I could have understood if the officer shot once in the legs to disable the guy and subsequently detain him. BUT HE SHOT HIM 3 FREAKING TIMES!! 3 TIMES!!

YOU DON'T SHOOT SOMEONE 3 TIMES UNLESS YOU INTEND TO KILL! THESE OFFICERS ARE TERRIBLY TRAINED"
"‚ÄúYou have to be in fear of your life before you use deadly force‚Äù


Aight fam need we say more?"
And just like the cops we're going to investigate ourselves and find ourselves not guilty.
Duane‚Äôs honesty
So could he have been considered an imminent threat because he was in possession of the officers Taser and he could have used it against the officer to acquire the officer's service pistol which could have possibly resulted in the death of both officers and possibly innocent bystanders?
1:25 That one guy that recorded the fight.
"Resisting arrest is never good, neither is pointing and firing an object at night at an officer. Sorry for his death, but a little wise decision making goes a long way. People need to learn you resist in court not in the street in the middle of the night."
seeing the comments for this video gives me hope for humanity.
He was asking for it taking that taser and using it against the police. That should be classified as suicide by cops.
"The real problem is two police officers should of been able to overpower him and subdue him. Instead they lost their tazer in the fight, and he did try to use it against them.

So The question is, ""Does Avoiding getting hit by a Tazer in a hostile situation warrant the use of daedly force?"""
"Honestly they did everything people have been saying police should do. The only wrong thing they did was shoot the guy, they should‚Äôve let him get away but we don‚Äôt know what was going through the guys mind he just watched his partner get assaulted and tased."
"I saw an individual resisting arrest then after that its anybody's guess. The individual might have been reaching for an officer's gun/taser during the scuffle. The point is he broke the law, it could have been all avoided if he just complied, and not resisted."
Drunken man makes terrible decisions that cost him his life. Two cops became judge jury and executioner. Should the guy have assaulted the police? No. Should that be a death sentence? Absolutely not.
"the POLICE would have finished arresting him and trying to put handcuffs on him, this man would have been alive. Instead this GIY started fighting POLICE and pulled the taser from cop. Started running and turned around and firedtazer toward cops. Then 1police officer shot him and then they did CPR  on him.  Sorry this guys life ended but, if he didn't do what he did, he would still be alive."
saying you have no weapon really doesn't mean anything anymore..
"Taser in United States is not considered a deadly weapon and also the guy was running away and he didn‚Äôt even really aimed at the police, just shot the taser behind him and kept running.The cop can‚Äôt even say he fear for his life because he chased after the guy and gunned him down. First Degree Murder. Premeditated. if anything, they should just let him go, they had his information his license plate, his face and his name and they could‚Äôve just picked him up later and took him to jail. I‚Äôm a lawyer here in Georgia."
"It makes me so sad to see that people think this is worth getting killed over. I'm not sure if it is just people picking teams to say things aren't as bad as black people have been saying it is. In this video the man talks about his daughters, remember the human element here. He should have been arrested, no one is disputing that. But to get killed over this, running away with a taser (while being under the influence) is egregious."
Thank you for teaching me what I saw.
"It's easy to monday night quarterback the situation after watching the altercation multiple times, in slow mo, from the comfort of your home. Their need to be a link to the nearest police department recruiting office in ever comment section."
"If the Cop really believes he is drunk, why don't they think he fought them under influence and let him run away since they got his ID, they have more than million ways of chatting him. He may even turn him self in when he is back to his senses. Is a person worth dying while trying to run away from you?"
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know if he was drinking at this point‚Äù. He fell asleep twice in the drive through with his car on. Luckily he didn‚Äôt run anyone over.
"They left out the non important part of the suspect taking the tazer from the officer, running away, and then firing the tazer at the officer.  That video was released before this one."
"Some shootings are just hate and unprovoked.  But most of these cop shootings involved some kind of struggle and running away.  Brooks struggled and fight his way including grabbing the police taser.   Even if Brooks is patted down and has no weapon on him.  Once he stole the taser, he can use it on the officer and then grab his gun.    Travon Martin also fought and tried to grab the gun away.   In the video, George Floyd also resisted and struggled with the police several moments before being kneed to death..  But these has a cause and effect, despite its overuse of force.  It may be the police force policy or training that made cops do this when the suspect is not complying."
"somehow only half the people can read, It says bodycam video shows moments leading up to fatal shooting, and with her saying that its new video its meant to add to the video that was already seen which included the taking of the empty taser and him fleeing, we already have seen that footage there's no editing out anything its just an additional input into the case."
"When the suspect turned around and pointed the taser at the officer; he could have hit the officer, thereby stunning him for a few seconds, which is long enough to grab his gun and kill him. I‚Äôm not saying this would have happened; but I‚Äôm saying it COULD have happened."
What is wrong with people now a day. What if the man had a heart attack? No one felt the need to come out and find out if he was ok. But instead they want to call the cop. Really? Are we serious? Was the cop needed? The wendy's manager didnt couldnt go out to find out what is wrong with the man. Or they are just affraid? I want to know.
"When you train police officers to be occupation forces, this will lead to the inevitably results."
"So, we really not gonna hold this man accountable for ANY of HIS actions that lead to the shooting? EVERYTHING is on the police officers? It's okay for him to act the way he acted, but, regardless of that, they should have made sure he was safe? I don't think the police did anything wrong. If he cooperates fully, he's still alive...the police isn't forced to react."
"That was beyond unnecessary, even if he had grabbed the stun gun he fired it rendering it useless, and they had the car, which made finding him easy. There was no reason to even consider him a threat that was basically see a man go down unload your weapon."
They need to teach to not resist arrest in schools.  This is what can happen when people are stupid.
"He drove under the influence, fell asleep in his car, resisted arrest, punched the police, stole a taser, upon fleeing turned and fired the taser at the police officer who no longer had the less lethal taser option."
He left out a big part of the use of deadly force. ‚ÄúIf your life or another is in imminent danger or threat of serious bodily injury‚Äù an officer getting tased and  eating cement is very very bad for the . Use of deadly force was authorized . Tasers are LESS lethal and not NON Lethal devices.
"I‚Äôm not watching the news anymore. I‚Äôve been so focused on watching every news network at night time that I even go to bed way past 9pm and this is not ok. 
I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll come back whenever we have positive news I‚Äôm over it now. I‚Äôm over it. "
"just for more clarity, there's another that has the perspective of the dashcam. It's much clearer. Though I think it's pretty obvious from this video that Brooks was resisting."
"Also way to omit the best angles. I believe some news organization in Atlanta released the full body-cam, and dash cam footage of the incident which shows everything in extreme clarity. They omit the clear footage of the shooting to leave it to your imagination as they tell you how poorly the officers handled the situation."
"I wonder why an employee couldnt have just went out and knocked on his window. Ive worked a Slow drive thru window before and people do doze off!  I just went out and knocked on glass, and that usually solved the problem!. I could see if I knocked and the person was unresponsive,but cleary, this wasnt the case."
"He doesn't have a weapon until he fights and takes a weapon in which then he has a weapon. He didn't mention that. He also didn't mention that he gained the DUI test. Bottom line, don't be a crook."
"I was totally wrapped up into the George Floyd incident and what happened to that poor man, but it got to be too much. I watch the big 3 on CNN just about every night, but lately I can't watch them because of have one-sided they are. Don Lemon is through the roof with it. As I said I haven't been watching the news, but I just watched the full video of this. WTF?? This cop did everything by the book and was completely tolerant, too tolerant, of this man and his actions. Again, we go back to another guy resisting, but he took it to another level and grabbed a weapon from the cop. WTF? I can't even finish this I'm so disgusted."
This is another reason why cops should be trained on deescalating situational procedures and communication
"The bias is always in the edit. Provide the full footage for the public to decide. This is what transparency, truth and credibility demands."
Although this is an example of what a suspect should never do because it's asking to be shot. What a cop has to remember is that if someone is running away from you and you shot them than you're killing in retaliation to them resisting you! The officer is not shooting the suspect in fear of his own survival!
The BROTHER WAS STRONG AS HELL . HE GOT AWAY FROM TWO PIGS .
Condolences to Rayshard Brooks' family and friends. Police would have handled this differently if he'd been white. Mr Brooks' fought back out of fear. It cost him his life.
Everybody talking about calling an uber. Dude should have called one before he left the house. How about that?
WHY DID CNN EDIT THE VIDEO TAKE OUT THE PART WHERE HE TOOK THE TASER GUN?
"Suggestion : People should not be murdered for falling victim to a physiological response (fight or flight) - 
How about we add an additional fine to adults who run from the police.. maybe $1k. Which will be paid by the suspect.. if there is proper picture ID.  Let them run, offer a rewards for info.. once that person is arrested. Be fine pay the rewards, & collect fine from suspect... By either garnishing wages, levying their accounts, taxes.. etc... But it's okay if that person isn't an immediate deadly threat to people around him/her."
Now i know the reason why i was never hired as a police officer.
"Drunk & passed out in drive thru, sobriety checked (failed), tried to arrest, resisted and fought officers (and won), escaped and fled with officers taser, then shot at officer with said taser, then stopped by police. 
Poor choice led to an even worse outcome."
"Proportionality requires that any measure that interferes with fundamental rights has a legitimate public purpose and is also appropriate, necessary and proportionate in the narrower sense (""appropriate""). A measure that does not meet these requirements is illegal. (german legal principle)"
"They don't want to accountable what they've done. They just want justice how they've treated of result of their behavior and I'm not talking about cop.

But I agree that cop could've used fire weapon more different way to minimize casualty but what if he tased cop and took his gun? they don't understand how dangerous it was."
"amazing how so many ppl claiming ""its just a taser"" that he stole dont seem to know what happens to a person that gets tased.

he aimed it back at the cops while running away which is shown on the wendys security camera footage."
I wasn‚Äôt there but I think the officer should have offered him a ride home. Perhaps ask the driver to call for a ride and tow his car.  Just trying to arrest wasn‚Äôt the answer.  I understand he was drunk but he was not not diving at the time of incident (sleeping in the car).  God help us as a Nation!
"Is one thing to get mad for a man getting shot on the back while running away from the cops. 

But it's a whole different situation when you grab a cop's taser and point it at him. I'm at the cop's side on this one."
Those justifying this killing do not get it are the reason we can not move forward.
"This guy doesn‚Äôt mention the perp took the taser and while he was running away turned around and pointed it at the officer.... all this guy had to do was go to jail, sleep it off and he would still be alive today. It‚Äôs his own fault"
He probably thought that the officer was planning to take his costo card.
Let that man run away. You have his car and his info. Don't shoot that man in the back for a minor or major offense.
